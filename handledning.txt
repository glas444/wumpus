You are in the culverts under CSC, where the gluttonous Wumpus lives.
To avoid getting eaten, you must shoot Wumpus with your arrow and bow.
The culverts have 20 rooms that are linked with narrow corridors. 
You can move north, south, west or east from one room to another.

However, there are dangers that lurks. In some rooms there are bottomless pits.
If you step into one of these you die immediately. Other rooms are full of
bats which picks you up, flys a bit and drops you in a random room.
In one of the rooms you may find Wumpus, and if you dare walk into that room
you will be eaten immediately. Luckily you can feel the breeze from the rooms
next to you. The wind from the abyss or the smell of Wumpus. You also get to 
know which rooms are next to you.

To win the game you must shoot your bow and pierce Wumpus with one of your
five arrows. When you shoot one of your arrows it can move through three rooms.
You can control which direction the arrow should move in each rooms. 
You may happen to slay yourself.

You can choose to either move or shoot.
If you select move, the button will be
kept pressed till you choose to use the bow.
If you select bow, the arrow will fly through
three rooms, and then get depleted.

You move the and the arrow with the arrow-keys
in directions North, South, West and East.

You have five arrows in your quiver
each marked with a dot inside.
Every arrow lasts through three rooms.

When one arrow has been used,
the leftmost marker disappears.

When a danger is near, the ground beneath the hero
will light up. If a more dangerous obstacle is near,
the ground will display that colour. 
 - Grey means that no danger is near.
 - Purple means that bats are closeby
 - Dark blue means that holes are nearby.
 - Wine red means that Wumpus is nextdoor.
